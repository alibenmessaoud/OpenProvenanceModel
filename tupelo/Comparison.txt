Tupelo:

 - Does not allow accounts to be specified for nodes, whereas this is
   permitted by the specification

   Workaround: none, so conversion to rdf is lossy here.

 - Does not seem to be able to create edges without accounts.  A
   minimum of one account seems to be mandatory.  Specification allows
   for edges without accounts to be specified.

   Workaround: I created a distinguished account "null"


 - Does not allow a given id to be specified for an edge

   Workaround: default resource id generated by tupelo is used.
      So conversion to rdf is lossy here
      (this prevents us to convert from xml to rdf and back)

 - Does not allow an annotation to a graph (there is no such notion in tupelo).

   Workaround: none
