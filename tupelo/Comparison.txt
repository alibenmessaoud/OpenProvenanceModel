Tupelo:

 - Does not allow accounts to be specified for nodes, whereas this is
   permitted by the specification

 - Does not seem to be able to create edges without accounts.  A
   minimum of one account seems to be mandatory.  Specification allows
   for edges without accounts to be specified.

 - Does not allow a given id to be specified for an edge
     (this prevents us to convert from xml to rdf and back)

 - Does not allow an annotation to a graph (there is no such notion in tupelo).
