Reproducibility
- create an instance of JavaExecute
- create a map from URI prefix to Execute
- dispatch to Execute according to primitive implementation name prefix
- make Execute interface more generic.
- allows for invocations

- cleanup the types in air.xml
- allow for multiple such air.xml to be loaded
- generate WasDerivedFrom edges, according to primitive specification

- modify factory so that it changes locations of files
- modify factory so that it supports input files
   current hardcoded in factory

- handle NS automatically (currently, statitc variable PC1_NS)

- softmean is configured to take only two images as input.
    

Validation

- test that a opm graph instance is compatible with owl ontology

- test that a opm graph instance is compatible with xml schema
  noteschema opm_v1.01 hardcoded in validator

- signatures of opm graphs
