- allow for multiple such air.xml to be loaded
- generate WasDerivedFrom edges, according to primitive specification

- modify factory so that it changes locations of files
- modify factory so that it supports input files

- handle NS automatically (currently, statitc variable PC1_NS)
    

Validation

- test that a opm graph instance is compatible with owl ontology

- test that a opm graph instance is compatible with xml schema
  noteschema opm_v1.01 hardcoded in validator
