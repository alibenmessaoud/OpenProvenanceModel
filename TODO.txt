- cleanup the types in air.xml

- Handle NS automatically. Currently, there is a single NS supported.
- Allow for multiple such air.xml files to be loaded
- Modify factory with more general functionality so that it better
  - changes locations of files
  - supports input files (current hardcoded in factory)

    

Validation

- test that a opm graph instance is compatible with owl ontology

- test that a opm graph instance is compatible with xml schema
  noteschema opm_v1.01 hardcoded in validator

- signatures of opm graphs
